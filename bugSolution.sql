The solution addresses the issues highlighted in the original bug report by improving NULL handling and using explicit type casting.  For NULL handling, using LEFT JOIN ensures that rows with no matching entries in the related table are still included, allowing for accurate identification of customers without orders.

```sql
-- Correct NULL handling using LEFT JOIN
SELECT c.* FROM Customers c LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID WHERE o.OrderID IS NULL;
```

For explicit type casting, the solution converts the string representation of a number to its numeric equivalent before comparing it with a numeric column:

```sql
-- Correct type casting
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductID = CAST('123' AS INT);
```

This ensures a precise comparison and avoids potential errors resulting from implicit data type conversions.
