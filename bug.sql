In SQL, a common yet often overlooked error is incorrect handling of NULL values.  Consider this scenario: you're trying to find all customers who haven't placed an order yet.  A naive approach might be: `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE OrderID IS NULL`.  This *seems* correct but could fail if OrderID is a NOT NULL column; if it's defined as NOT NULL, it won't ever be NULL, so the query will return nothing, even if some customers truly lack associated orders.  A better approach involves checking for the absence of an order in a related table, perhaps using a LEFT JOIN and checking for NULLs in the related table's columns, like this:

```sql
SELECT c.* FROM Customers c LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID WHERE o.OrderID IS NULL;```

This approach is robust because it accounts for scenarios where there's no order information associated with a customer, regardless of how the OrderID column is defined.  Another subtle error arises when mixing data types implicitly.  For example, comparing a string column to a number without explicit type casting can lead to unexpected results. SQL might perform an implicit conversion, but this can be inefficient and might not behave as intended across different database systems.

```sql
-- Incorrect
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductID = '123'; -- Comparing string to number

-- Correct
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductID = CAST('123' AS INT); -- Explicit type casting
```
